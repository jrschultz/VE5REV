The quest for the ultimate portable 2M Antenna is over. The 2M Moxon, designed by [DL2MAN](https://www.printables.com/model/976419-vhf-uhf-moxon-antennas) is where it's at. He's got [a great YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9c3AjUn_Vvo?si=HAV9xpxYTfY9voB8) that explains the whole build.

## The Build

Get your 3D Printer fired up because this whole build can be pretty much printed, including the 10mm support tubes. I guess those are very common in Germany/Europe but they were not available anywhere in VE5. Thankfully [Angus Findlay](https://www.printables.com/model/1252145-tubes-for-moxon-antenna) designed a print for the tubes too. Our local legendary ham, VE5ARV, was able to print this entire kit for me. The tubes were too long for his printer so he printed them as interlocking parts. Then I simply slipped a shrink wrap over the seem to strengthen it up.

The BNC connector is probably the fiddliest part of the build. Getting it situated in the part, secured and ready for solder is a bit tricky.

## The Wire

I used 22AWG BNTECHGO silicon wire that I had in the junk box. It just so happened to be matching orange colour! It fits the tubes like a glove.

Wire measurements were:

+ **Driven Elements:** 2 x 460mm + 10mm for the knot = 470mm

+ **Reflector:** 1004mm + 20mm (for 2 knots) = 1024mm

## The Setup

This antenna pops together in no time. I put it up on a paint pole to check it on the NanoVNA.

It turned out not too shabby! About 1.5:1 SWR across the entire 2M band.

I easily keyed up our local repeater but couldn't hit the neighbouring city's repeaters with 5 watts on the Yaesu FT-65. I will definitely try it with more power and a bit higher elevation and see if we can squeeze any more out of the extra ~5dB of gain.

## Conclusion

Look no further than this amazing build for an ultra portable 2M antenna. You can use it for FM and SSB and everything else. It collapses down into a very portable package, suitable for hiking, camping, EMCOMMs, you name it. It took less than 15 minutes to build. This is one banger beam for 2M!
