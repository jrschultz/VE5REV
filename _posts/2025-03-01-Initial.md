# Welcome

Greetings HamFam. This site has been created as "build notes" for amateur radio. There are so many opinions, falsehoods and bad information on the internet about pretty much *every topic*, but especially amateur radio. This site is composed of first-hand, researched and field tested notes about antennas, chokes and transformers, primarily with the mobile operator in mind.
