Linked dipoles and EFHW antennas are a really great way to have efficient, resonant, portable antennas that are multi-banded. I've never come across a linking method that I really liked. I've had bullet connectors tear apart in the field. I don't like stuff that is fragile for field use. I was thinking about a better linking system that was robust and still lightweight for even QRP antennas.

## Wago: The Ultimate Link

I've used Wago lever nuts in lots of ham radio applications. They are so convenient and handy. I was looking at these double connectors and then it hit me. It's the ideal antenna link. I prototyped the concept with a lock n' lock plastic container. Using a hole saw drill bit, I drilled out a 1.25" circle. I hot glued a Wago 221-412 connector in the center afte drilling out the wire attachment holes. The concept is you tie your antenna wire to the plastic and then just pop an end in and out of the Wago connector to link and unlink the antenna sections. This was pretty good, very light weight but it seemed a bit bulky.

## 3D Printed Version

I started researching to see if someone had already built this idea. As far as I can tell, it has never been used for an antenna link. But someone had already designed a 3D Printed holder for Wago lever nuts. To my delight I found the ideal piece, already done up. [Sternmarke on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4825415) is an absolute legend! I fired the files over to VE5ARV and Garvin printed one up for me to test fit. It fits the Wago like a glove. The design is almost totally perfect. A person could remix this design to fill in the spaces on the top and back if desired. However, as it is, it gives a great spot to adhere hot glue or super glue to make sure the Wago connector stays put.

This is truly an ultralight solution. The assembly only weights 4g/.1oz per link! This is awesome for the SOTA bros or anyone who does backpack portable ops.

## The Files

As I mentioned above, you can get the .STL files on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4825415). Be mindful that he makes 3 versions of this double connector. Make sure you print the one for the model you have. I will host the files here too for redundancy/safe keeping but design attribution goes to [Sternmarke](https://www.thingiverse.com/sternmarke/designs). **The one I used in this build was the 221-412.**

Thanks again to VE5ARV for bringing this concept to 3D printed glory!
