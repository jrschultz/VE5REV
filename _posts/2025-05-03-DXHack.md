The biggest problem with the DX Commander Expedition mast is that the top section sits pretty much flush when collapsed, making it awkward and a real pain to grab. This simple hack fixes this problem.

## The Fix

So it's a super easy fix. Glue lined shrink wrap and a piece of 95 paracord. The paracord is roughly the same diameter as the top section. Just cut around a 2" piece and then adhere it on with shrink wrap. I used clear because I had it in stock and it was nice fit. Give it a blast with a heat gun and viola! It works to give you something to grab hold of when you want to put the mast up. And, it's non destructive. You can peel it off if you need to at the cost of a shrink wrap. The paracord just coils on top of the sections when you want to put the rubber cap on. Not too shabby!
