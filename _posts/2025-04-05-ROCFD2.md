I have been doing a lot of investigation into 4:1 Baluns for Off-Center Fed Dipoles. In my [other post](https://jrschultz.github.io/VE5REV/posts/ResidentialOCFD/) I had used a 4:1 Current Balun - two 1:1 chokes back to back, with another 1:1 for added common mode current suppression. Essentially this is called a *Hybrid Balun*. And it was probably overkill because the 4:1 Current Balun has choking built in. But then I came across the absolute *opus* of a resource on the topic from [DJ0IP](https://www.dj0ip.de/off-center-fed-dipole/balun-selection/). His research indicates that a hybrid balun is indeed the better way to go, but using a 4:1 *voltage balun* instead of a current balun. This was contrary to everything *I thought I knew* about this topic.

## Voltage vs. Current

So the crux of the issue is that Off-Center Fed Dipoles are badly susceptible to common-mode current. Using a voltage balun to force equal voltage on the radiators exacerbates the problem. So everyone went the opposite direction and recommended using a 4:1 current balun instead, because not only can it transform the 200 ohms to 50, but it can also choke CMC at the same time. It required two separate cores to do this, adding weight and complexity. But the common mode issue still remained, despite the better performance of the 4:1 current balun. 

## The Hybrid

Enter the Hybrid. This became the solution to the issues of using one voltage or current balun. All the hard work has been done on this issue already. Check out [The Hitchhiker's Guide to OCFD](https://www.dj0ip.com/hhg2-ocfd). Rick, DJ0IP has got YouTube videos, PDF downloads and everything there. This is not some keyboard experts in a Facebook forum! This is all compiled, first hand field research. It doesn't get any better than this as a resource. 

## ROCFD 2.0

With all of this new found information I rebuilt my balun. I kept the wire dimensions the same as the original Residential version. [PDF file here](https://github.com/jrschultz/VE5REV/blob/main/assets/ROCFD/ResidentialOCFD.pdf). In this setup, the long element is connected to coax center and the short is connected to shield. But it's all connected in the balun so I'm pretty sure it doesn't really matter.

### The Cores
For the Voltage balun (Ruthroff), I used my favourite Fatty Type 43 core 2643251002. Rick recommends a Type 61 instead, due to having better thermals for digital modes. If I was to build a QTH version of this antenna for long-term use, I would use the Type 61 5961002701 1.400" (35.56mm) Diameter. You'd want the 2.4" version if you want higher power. But I had the Fatty in stock and the chunky geometry usually does a great job as a transformer. 

For the choke, I used the Type 31 2631801202 core. These are stellar -30dB suppression performers and very compact at only 1.142" Dia (29.01mm) outside diameter.

### The Wire

I used the 18AWG solid core wire for both cores. This wire seems to work very well for both chokes and transformers.

### Open Concept

I have this plastic puck-board base that I use for testing antennas. I decided to use it for this build. I installed a couple honkin' huge mounting posts that I had in the junk drawer. I sized everything up, pre-fitting the connections to make sure everything was good to go.

And, would you look at that! 'Tis a balun happy face!

I secured everything down with a couple of zip ties and checked the connections for conductivity.

### NanoVNA Testing

I put a 200 ohm resistor setup across the terminals to test the transformation. And I put the same setup across the current balun too for comparison. Both the voltage and the current balun are hybrids with a built in choke. The SWR readings are incredibly similar with the slight edge going to the voltage build.

With this voltage build, the worst SWR is 3:1 on the 10M band. This would be easily handled with an internal rig tuner. And the values get better the lower you go. So as a portable option from 80M thru 10M, this antenna is golden with a tuner. 

**NOTE:**

>I think this response curve is due to the Fatty 43 core I'm using in both builds. We noticed the same kind of response when we used one to build a 1:1 choke. It's much better for the lower bands. I think this requires further testing with different cores (Type 61) to see if the higher band response might get better. As is though, this will make a great setup for the upcoming solar cycle minimums where low bands will be the top dog. 

## Field Testing

I was eager to get this antenna in a tree. Well, technically 3 trees. Deploying this antenna is a bit of a pain for portable work because you need trees in the right spots. It can be rather involved. I stretched the antenna out on the ground to see if it would line up with the trees in the park. I then got my paracord lines up in the trees and attached to the antenna. I raised up the center first and then the elements. This was deployed East/West with the long element on the west side. You can't see anything in this image, but trust me it's all there LOL. It was only about 24' high and really should have been higher.

### WSPR Tests

I checked the SWR on the Nano and the antenna needed to be trimmed but I didn't adjust it. The dips were in all the right places, under 3:1 SWR on 10M, 15M, 20M and 40M. This could be further adjusted with better deployment height and trimming. As it was, 15m was right on and 20 wasn't heinous so I decided to just go as is for the WSPR testing. I did 1 watt, 20 minutes tests for each of the 15M and 20M bands.

#### 15M Testing

The pattern on 15M was a bit weird. Perhaps there weren't many stations on 15M at the time of testing.

**Total Contacts:** 95

**SNR:**

+ Max: +13 Min: -27 Avg: -11

**KM Distance:**

+ Max: 3165 Min: 1902 Avg: 2340

#### 20M Testing

The 20M pattern is quite good with nice coverage across North America. 

**Total Contacts:** 541

**SNR:**

+ Max: +06 Min: -34 Avg: -15

**KM Distance:**

+ Max: 2876 Min: 1031 Avg: 1901

### Summary

I **did not** put an additional 1:1 balun at the rig end of the coax. I was able to run WSJT-X software for WSPR and the IC-705 without any RFI issues at all (I didn't use the USB isolator or any ferrite beads on the USB cable). To me, this suggests that the 1:1 choke in the Hybrid balun is really doing it's job. The IC-705 is a fussy beast and it performed with no issues with this setup. 

I'm for sure going to deploy this for a proper POTA activation and use as many bands as possible to give it a good work out. Look for a further blog post about that in the future!
