Without question, the NanoVNA is the MVP of ham radio. There is no other tool so versatile and feature rich for the price. Here's how to upgrade the firmware to the latest version on Linux. It appears daunting but it's actually easy. I'm showing how to download the ready-made files and flash them instead of building from source.

## Step 1: Check Existing Firmware Version

Check your existing firmware from the Main Menu>CONFIG>VERSION

![VERSION](/assets/Firmware/Firmware02.webp)

## Step 2: Download Updated Firmware Files

The firmware files are hosted on the [DiSlord github page.](https://github.com/DiSlord/NanoVNA-D) On the right hand side of the page there is a link with "Releases." This is where the files are that we need. Click that link.

Depending on your version (either H4 or H), download the 3 files ending in ```.bin .dfu .hex``` Save these files to directory like ```/NanoFiles``` or wherever you know they will be.

## Step 3: Prepare Linux

Back on the main [Github repo page](https://github.com/DiSlord/NanoVNA-D) scroll down until you see these code blocks that you can copy. There's specific ones for Ubuntu and Debian. But the Ubuntu stuff will work for Arch or any other distro, you just need to install the ```dfu-util``` package with your distro's package manager instead of apt. This is the package that will flash the firmware to the NanoVNA. 

So copy the code block and swap 'apt install' for pacman or dnf or whatever distro you're on. This will install the packages and dependencies.

## Step 4: Hookup the NanoVNA

Attach your Nano to your computer with a USB cable. 

Push the rocker switch in whilst turning the NanoVNA on. If you did this correctly, the screen will be totally black (H4 version) or totally white (H version).  

The Nano is now ready to be updated.

## Step 5: Flash the Firmware

Again on the main github page, scroll down to the section entitled **Flash Firmware.** Ignore all the stuff other than the code blocks that have the commands. The other stuff pertains to building the files from source.

Copy the command you need for your version.

In Terminal, paste the command you copied **BUT we need to edit the text in the blue boxes**. 

Change the text in the blue boxes to match where you have your files saved to and change the ```.bin``` file to the actual file name version you downloaded. Example:

```/home/jason/Downloads/NanoFiles/NanoVNA-H4.v1.2.40.bin```

So your updated command would be:

```dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D /home/jason/Downloads/NanoFiles/NanoVNA-H4.v1.2.40.bin```

Press Enter. It will immediately start flashing the new firmware and only takes less than a minute to complete.

## Step 6: Verify it Worked

Just repeat Step 1 and see if your firmware version matches the one you downloaded. And, viola! You're up to date with the latest fixes and features.
