At Winter Field Day 2025, I got to witness exactly what happens when you don't choke coax. We had our newly made [VA6AM](https://va6am.com/) band pass filters and triplexer setup and ready for their inaugural use.  We were stoked to be able to have 4 stations operating at the same time for the first time in club history. We hooked everything up and got ready to operate. We started transmitting and everything worked awesome! But then, *it* happened. *Whathahath ahtahthat whaaaahah* ... we could hear distortion from our adjacent stations coming through the rigs. Thankfully we had some (*really poor*) 1:1 chokes on hand. We installed them and our issues subsided.

### What Happened?

What was happening? The coax shields were acting as antennas and picking up the adjacent station RF signals. This is what can happen all the time with coax. Stray signals can get picked up and bring that *noise* back to the shack. It's a total pain. But thankfully there's an easy fix. The miraculous 1:1 choke. Also called a choke balun or a balun choke or a 1:1 current balun. I just call them a choke based on their function. We want to choke those stray RFI signals. And also, common mode current that will likewise slip back down the outside braid of the coax and cause havoc. 

### How Does It Work?

A choke acts just like a one-way valve for common mode current (CMC). The desired *differential* current can pass but the bad common mode cannot come back through it.

### How Do You Build Them?

They're really quite easy to build. All you need is wire and a toroidal core. There are "dirty baluns" that are just loops of coax and they can work. There are also ferrite beads you can place on the outside of the coax or other wires. But nothing is as good as a toroidal 1:1 choke in my opinion.

I did a bunch of research into core types and builds before our club set out to make a set for Field Day use. I settled on two core types: 31 and 43. Both of these cores, when wrapped with solid-core 18AWG wire, offered around -30dB or better attenuation. -20dB is considered great. So the performance of these cores is outstanding. Depending on the application, you can choose different core sizes. Bigger cores are for QRO and smaller are for QRP use. As far as I can gather, there aren't any hard and fast industry standards about power ratings. Commercial product retailers will advertise various power ratings on their products. You can get an approximation from that. I also read that chokes will lose 40% of their power rating if SWR is 2:1 and 60-70% at 3:1. So it's good to keep SWR well managed. 

#### Type 31 Cores

+ **Size: 1.142" (29.01mm) OD. Core: 2631801202 $2.13 in 2025** 

This was wrapped with 12 Turns (6 and 6 with a cross-over) of 18AWG solid-core wire:

This was wrapped with 12 Turns of RG316 Coax:

As you can see, there is basically zero difference between the two wire types. I wrapped this core several different ways in my testing and pretty much everything gave these same kind of -30dB attenuation results. It's a very handy little size for incorporating into other builds like End Fed Half Wave transformers, dipole centers, etc. I'd run 100 watts SSB through it.

+ **Size: 2.4" (60.96mm) OD. Core: 2631803802 $13.15 in 2025**

Based on the research from [Jim Brown K9YC](http://k9yc.com/publish.htm), I wrapped this larger core with 14AWG Romex wire (house wire). It likewise performed much like the smaller Type 31 core. Due to it's larger size I decided to use this as a choke for my 71' Random Wire QTH antenna.

#### Type 43 Cores

+ **Size: 1.4" (35.55mm) OD. Core: 5943002701 $4.85 in 2025**

The Type 43 core has even *greater* attenuation performance than the 31 Type, especially on the 20M and 30M bands. This is the core our club ended up building our chokes with.

+ **Size: 1.540" (39.12mm) OD Core: 2643251002 $12.22 in 2025**

Just for fun, I wanted to see if my favourite transformer core was also a good performer as a choke. Look at that performance! -44dB on the 40M band. We made one choke out of this core for the club for the low bands/FT8.

#### Wire

The simplest thing would be to just use coax. It's a proper 50Î© and has long been recommended for this reason. The only glitch is the end product is bulkier as you can't wrap coax as tightly as other wire. Recently a move towards Teflon PTFE has been recommended for it's high heat/high voltage rating. The exhaustive [K9YC research {p.4ff}](http://k9yc.com/2018Cookbook.pdf) also suggest 12AWG Romex for larger cores. Certainly there will be a slight impedance mismatch but it's not that big a deal. 

In my testing, I couldn't see a performance difference from the wiring material. Or even how I wrapped the cores for that matter. It was all very consistent. We ended up using 18AWG solid core wire, 12 turns with a cross over for our club chokes.

### Performance

As mentioned already, -20dB attenuation is great and anything more than that is tremendous. The performance of our DIY chokes is in the tremendous category as illustrated above with the NanoVNA measurements. Here's a couple of examples of the performance from commercial choke products:

#### LDG

I'd been using LDG's 1:1 chokes since I got involved with Ham Radio. So naturally I had to see what kind of performance they offer:

![LDG](./assets/Chokes/LDG-1_1-LEADS.jpg)

That is extremely poor performance! And yet without measuring them, how would you ever know? Often manufacturers won't publish any performance data. I ended up gutting my LDG chokes and installing our DIY cores inside. You can see that it's some kind of iron powder core instead of a ferrite.

#### Palomar

One of our club members had bought a Palomar choke advertised with -46dB of attenuation. But we used this choke on Field Day for our 10M station. Guess what? His radio kept getting lit up by the adjacent station. Any guesses why?

![Palomar](./assets/Chokes/1_1-PALOMAR.jpg)

You can see why. It's got legit -47dB on 160M. But on 10M only -16dB! So it's not *false advertising*, per se, but it doesn't have that same attenuation across the amateur bands.

They use this really cool sprayfoam type stuff to keep their chokes from rattling around. Pretty nifty!

### Other Observations 

Interesting things happen when you stack choke ores or change the winding count. The following measurement is from two Type 31 1.142" cores stacked. By changing the overall geometry of the choke, it starts to have more attenuation on the lower bands, more resembling the chunky Type 43 core above.

Likewise, when I added two more wire turns to the 12 we ended up going with, it started to bend the low end attenuation down while raising the top end up. I guess to this end you could "tune" a choke to have more or less attenuation, like if you primarily worked the 40m band and wanted extra there at the expense of top bands you might not care about.

Measuring choke performance is easy with the handy NanoVNA. The video links below are the resources I used to setup and configure my NanoVNA.
