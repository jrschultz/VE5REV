In the [ROCFD 2.0](https://jrschultz.github.io/VE5REV/posts/ROCFD2/) post I settled on using a hybrid 4:1 voltage balun over the current balun for it's greater ability to suppress common mode current. Essentially, you can use 2 cores instead of 3. That's weight, cost and complexity savings in a nutshell. But what I noticed was that both of the hybrid designs I built had the same runaway on the higher frequencies. 1:1.2 at 80M becomes 3.0:1 on 10M. This is not good. I observed this same response with a 200Ω and an actual antenna wire.

## Version 2.1

I ordered some type 61 cores with the hypothesis that the response curve must have been the product of the Type 43 Fatty (2643251002) cores I was using in those previous 2 builds. I got the Type 61 (5961002701 1.400" (35.56mm) Outside diameter) and immediately made another hybrid balun for testing.

Lo and behold, it was *better*, but basically the same as the previous two builds with the higher frequencies taking off.

Hypothesis was out the window. Something other than core type was causing this wild inductive reactance on the higher bands.

The Smith Chart trace really illustrates well what's going on. From 80M-30M there is basically 50 ohm resistive component. But by 20M and up, that number hits the stratosphere! 128.1 on the 10M band. Plus the addition of the inductive reactance further exacerbating everything. 

## Shunt Capacitor Experiment

I figured I would try to counter some of that inductive reactance with a capacitor, much like you do in an EFHW build. 

### 150pF

I started with a 150pF capacitor and behold! It knocked the stuffing out of the high end, bringing the resitive component from 128Ω to 34.46Ω on 10M. That's a massive adjustment. Too much, in fact.

### 120pF

I swapped out the 150 for 120pF and it helped bring things closer to 50Ω across the HF bands.

### 100pF

It was really cool to watch the effect that changing the capacitor value had on the performance! The 100pF provided matching to make the resitive component extremely close to 50Ω. This was a massive and near miraculous improvement!

## What Does This Mean?

The addition of a capacitor in the hybrid balun design has brought the over all performance to nearly 50Ω resistive load across the HF spectrum. There is still the reactive component that I bet could be tweaked even further with a more precisely matched capacitor. This results in a more efficient antenna that could be used *without a tuner* from 80M-10M. However, this antenna is going to be used with a tuner to clean up that inductive reactance. With this design tweak, an internal rig tuner could *easily* do that. So now you have a great multi-band antenna for portable work without having to bring a dedicated tuner. POTA, anyone?
