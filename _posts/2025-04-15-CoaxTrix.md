I generally hate working with Coax because the braid is a royal pain to deal with. It's finicky and cumbersome. However, I learned a snazzy way of dealing with it that has made my life 17% better. 

### Step 1: Score Outside

Score the outside casing of the coax and gently pull the plastic off the end.

### Step 2: Push Braid

Push the braid backwards into a loose ball.

### Step 3: Make a Hole

Using a screw or other sharpish tool, gently make a hole in the clumped up braid.

### Step 4: Ream

Using a screwdriver gently ream the hole out and go under the coax center.

### Step 6: Viola!

Look at that! The braid is largely intact and you can twist it and solder it as needed for your application.

It's so simple but so effective!
