The Rybakov antenna is a great choice for a portable vertical antenna. *Rybakov* is Russian for 'fisherman' - a connection to this 'random wire' being around 8m long, able to be deployed on a fishing rod mast. As a non-resonant antenna, it does require a tuner. It gives you 40m-6m bands in a relatively compact form factor.

### Introduction

_**As with everything on this site, the following notes are from first hand research and testing.**_

I found that the best length to work with is a 7.6m (25') wire length. This is what gives the Rybakov it's magic. This is a 3/8-wave vertical on the 20m band which most likely explains what gives this antenna its pizzazz. I used 18AWG speaker wire that I bought at RONA. I paired this with my DX Commander mast and deployed it as a straight vertical for maximum take off angle. This system needs 2 more components: A) a 4:1 UnUn and B) somekind of ground plane/counterpoise. 

### The UnUn

As with all my End Fed transformer builds these days, I'm incorporating a 1:1 choke. This is for convenience as well as isolating the coax and keeping it from resonating. The main core I used is a Type 43 2643251002 and the choke coire is the Type 31 2631801202. I used these because I had them in stock. But I would choose these if I was buying them especially for this project. The core efficiency and choke performance of these cores are great. And you can get both into a 100 x 68 x 50 mm project box as shown here:

I followed the Coffee and Ham Radio's [build instructions](https://github.com/TemporarilyOffline/cahrtenna/blob/main/CaHRTenna%20Poseidon%20Build%20Instructions.pdf) for their Poseidon antenna for the 4:1. The 1:1 is just 12 turns of 18AWG solid core wire with a cross over. 

### Counterpoise Systems

There has been much discussion about ground plane/counterpoise systems for vertical antennas. The first thing you hear online is that you need to have 17 billion radials on the ground. I personally hate radials, especially for portable operations. They are a cumbersome pain in the butt, a tripping hazard, take up a ton of real estate and they are lossy to boot. A pile of RF energy is spent heating up the ground. There has got to be a better way. And, there is.

#### Magic Carpet

Aluminum screen and now Faraday cloth have been used 'successfully' with the Rybakov. Just use a wire with an alligator clip to the ground lug on the transformer. I installed grommet holes in my Faraday cloth so you can use a tent peg to keep it flat. In winter I just use snow as shown here. If you value setup speed, this is the ultimate way. Simon, VA7BIX has also done [experimentation](https://youtu.be/PA2KTFpTpKE?si=FVbHvS7HIP5LSF6Y) using a mylar blanket under ground radials with good results.

#### Elevated Radials

What the magic carpets offer in convenience they also give up in loss. They are still coupled to the ground, sucking away radiating power. So my question was: can a non-resonant antenna be used with elevated tuned radials? The answer is absolutely *yes*! I tried a couple of configurations and did a bunch of WSPR tests, mainly checking for radiation patterns.

##### 'Bunch Radials'

I cut 5, 1/4 wave resonant wires for 20m-10m. I soldered the ends together to a ring terminal and then used some shrink wrap and zip ties to keep the bunch together. The concept is much the same as a DX Commander antenna. The desired tuned frequency finds its radial in the bunch while the rest of the wires represent a high impedance. The tuner tuned everything up just fine, 40m-6m with this setup. The wires were elevated up on plastic fencing posts around 3'.

The next question I had was will this setup have directivity? I tested it with WSPR to check the reception pattern. This image is the bunch radials pointed due East:

This image is the bunch radials pointed due South:

To my eye, there doesn't seem to be much difference or gain in the direction of the elevated bunch radials.

Here is the SWR readings from this system before using the tuner:

As you can see, an internal rig tuner could easily handle 10M, 12M, 15M and probably even 30M. But for 17M & 20M, you're going to need a beefier tuner. I tuned everything with my LDG Z-11ProII no problem.

#### PERFormer Radials

I made a set of POTA PERFormer elevated radials by Greg KJ6ER. These are linked, tuned radials. When deployed in a 60-90 degree setup, they provide directivity. They tuned up just fine, but you manually had to adjust them between switching bands. Again, there was not much difference in the patterns:

### Pattern Test Data

[Click Here](/assets/Rybakov/RybakovPatternTests.pdf) for a .PDF of all the Pattern Test Data.

### Performance Test Data

This information is forthcoming. I will be using [WSRP.rocks](https://wspr.rocks/) to measure the signal report differences between these systems.
