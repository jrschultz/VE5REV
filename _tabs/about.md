# Welcome 

Greetings HamFam. This site has been created as "build notes" for amateur radio. There are so many opinions, falsehoods and bad information on the internet about pretty much every topic, but *especially* amateur radio. This site is chock full of first-hand, researched and field tested notes about antennas, chokes and transformers, primarily with the mobile operator in mind.
